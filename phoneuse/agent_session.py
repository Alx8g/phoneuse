"""Who controls the phone: the one record every part of phoneuse reads.

States:
  idle       the owner is in control
  requested  an agent asked to start, and waits for the owner ("ask") or a countdown
             ("countdown") to end
  driving    an agent may act until `until`; every action moves `until` AGENT_IDLE s ahead
  paused     the owner took over; agents are refused until the owner resumes

Every transition happens here and nowhere else:
  idle       --act, access "auto"-------------------------> driving
  idle       --ask------------------------------------------> requested
  requested  --allow, or the countdown ends ----------------> driving
  requested  --deny, no answer, agent gave up, done --------> idle
  driving    --act-------------------------------------------> driving (until moves ahead)
  driving    --done, or AGENT_IDLE s without an action ------> idle
  any        --take over-------------------------------------> paused
  paused     --resume----------------------------------------> idle

The HID daemon's agent gate, the browser mirror, the companion app's state and Live
Activity, and the notifications all derive from this record: listeners hear about every
change (with a reason), and nothing else keeps its own copy of the session. Time-based
changes (the session running out, a countdown ending, a request going unanswered) happen
in tick(), which the server calls twice a second and every read calls too.
