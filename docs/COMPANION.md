# The companion app

The companion app is the iOS app where the owner allows and stops agents; agents are refused until one is
paired. With it, the phone shows a Live Activity while an agent uses the phone, the owner can approve unlocks and take over from the phone, and the owner can
change Phone Use's settings (the bridge, keep-awake, the keyboard, the mirror's audio) without the PC.

The app talks to the Phone Use PC over the local network, through the companion API that this file describes. The
PC starts, updates and ends the Live Activity with Apple push notifications (APNs), so the app doesn't need to run.

## Finding and pairing

The PC's companion API listens on TCP port 8778 on the local network and advertises itself over Bonjour as
`_phoneuse._tcp`, with TXT records `id` (the PC's id, 16 hex characters) and `name` (the PC's name).

Pairing gives the app a 32-byte key that it shares with the PC. `phoneuse app pair` makes a pairing link:

```
phoneuse://pair?id=<pc id>&name=<pc name, URL-encoded>&host=<LAN IP>&port=8778&key=<key, base64url without padding>
```

Phone Use can open the link on the phone by itself (it types the link into Safari's address bar), and the browser
mirror's settings show the same link as a QR code. The app saves the key in the Keychain, and the PC saves it in
`~/.config/phoneuse/companion.json` (mode 600). A pairing link works once, for 10 minutes. The app keeps the
host it was given and falls back to Bonjour (by `id`) when the PC's address changes.

Agents need a paired app: while none is paired, the PC refuses every agent action and keeps the HID daemon's
agent gate closed, because the app is where the owner allows and stops agents. When the app unpairs, it sends
`DELETE /v1/pairing` first, so the PC forgets its key. `phoneuse app unpair` (or Unpair in the Phone Use
window) forgets every app from the PC's side.

## Signing requests

Every request carries three headers:

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `X-PU-Time` | Unix time in seconds |
| `X-PU-Nonce` | 16 random bytes, hex |
| `X-PU-Sig` | hex HMAC-SHA256 with the pairing key over `METHOD\nPATH\nTIME\nNONCE\nSHA256HEX(BODY)` |

`PATH` includes the query string, if any, and `BODY` is the exact request body (empty for GET). The PC refuses a
request whose time is more than 60 s off or whose nonce it has seen in the last 120 s, with status 401.

Secrets (the passcode and Wi-Fi passwords) travel sealed: `{"sealed": "<base64 of nonce(12) | ciphertext | tag(16)>"}`,
AES-256-GCM with the key HKDF-SHA256(pairing key, salt empty, info `"phoneuse seal"`, 32 bytes) and the field name
(`"passcode"` or `"password"`) as associated data.

Every response is JSON. Errors are `{"error": "<short sentence for the owner>"}` with status 4xx or 5xx.

## Endpoints

| Method and path | Body | What the PC does |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /v1/state` | | Returns the state below |
| `POST /v1/agent/takeover` | `{}` | Stops the agent: its next action fails with "the user took over" |
| `POST /v1/agent/resume` | `{}` | Lets the agent continue |
| `POST /v1/unlock/answer` | `{"id", "approve": bool}` | Answers a pending unlock request |
| `POST /v1/session/ask` | `{"mode": "auto" \| "countdown" \| "ask", "seconds": 5-30}` | Agent control (either field alone) |
| `POST /v1/session/answer` | `{"id", "approve": bool}` | Answers a pending session request |
| `POST /v1/passcode` | `{"sealed"}` (field `passcode`) | Saves the passcode that unlocks use |
| `DELETE /v1/passcode` | | Forgets the passcode |
| `POST /v1/awake` | `{"on": bool}` | Keep the screen awake or not |
| `POST /v1/keyboard` | `{}` | Shows or hides the on-screen keyboard (the Eject key) |
| `GET /v1/cursor` | | `{"pointer": "on" \| "off" \| "unknown"}`: whether the pointer (AssistiveTouch) works; the pointer hops between two spots for ~2 s to find out |
| `POST /v1/cursor` | `{"on": bool}` | Turns the pointer on or off by asking Siri out loud through the PC's speakers; up to ~15 s, the phone unlocked and in earshot. An action, not a setting: show it as a row that confirms first |
| `POST /v1/bridge/use` | `{"on": bool}` | Sends input through the bridge, or through the PC's own Bluetooth |
| `GET /v1/bridge/networks` | | `{"networks": [{"ssid", "rssi", "secure"}]}` that the bridge sees |
| `POST /v1/bridge/network` | `{"ssid", "sealed"}` (field `password`) | Moves the bridge to that Wi-Fi network |
| `DELETE /v1/bridge` | | Forget Bridge…: the bridge resets itself and the PC forgets it. `{"saved": null, "reset": bool, "why"}`; `reset` is false (with `why`) when the bridge didn't answer the reset |
| `POST /v1/mirror/audio` | `{"on": bool}` | Turns the mirror's audio on or off (see Audio) |
| `POST /v1/push` | see Push | Registers the app's push tokens |
| `DELETE /v1/pairing` | | Unpairs this app: the PC forgets its key |

`GET /v1/state` returns:

```json
{
  "pc": {"id": "…", "name": "lxe-desktop", "version": "9ccd370"},
  "mirroring": true,
  "phone": "LXEPhone17Pro",
  "bluetooth": {"connected": true, "via": "bridge"},
  "agent": {"state": "idle | driving | paused", "action": "Opening Gmail", "since": 1794153854, "steps": 3,
            "phase": "acting | reading | thinking (while driving), else null"},
  "awake": true,
  "audio": {"on": true, "needs_remirror": false},
  "session": {"ask": true, "mode": "countdown", "seconds": 10,
              "pending": {"id": "…", "since": 1794153854, "action": "Opening Gmail", "mode": "countdown",
                          "deadline": 1794153864}},
  "unlock": {"passcode_saved": true, "pending": {"id": "…", "since": 1794153854}},
  "bridge": {"saved": true, "id": "…", "ip": "192.168.0.51", "ssid": "Giraffe IoT", "use": true,
             "online": true, "rtt_ms": 15}
}
```

`session.pending`, `unlock.pending` and `bridge` are `null` when there is no pending request or no bridge.

`bridge.connected` says whether the bridge reaches the iPhone, and `bridge.phone` names that iPhone (or is
`null`). `pc_bluetooth.on` says whether the PC also uses its own Bluetooth as the iPhone's keyboard and mouse
(Use This PC's Bluetooth); it is switched only on the PC, since turning it on asks for the PC's administrator
password. With it on, input goes through the bridge while the bridge reaches the iPhone, and through the PC's
Bluetooth otherwise.

`bridge.signal` has two levels, each `"good"`, `"fair"`, `"weak"` or `null` (unknown): `wifi`, the bridge's Wi-Fi
(good from −65 dBm, fair from −76 dBm), and `phone`, the Bluetooth link between the bridge and the iPhone (the
bridge measures it every 2 s; firmware 0.2.1 and later). `bridge.warning` is `null` or `{"title", "detail"}`:
"Bridge is offline" (check power and Wi-Fi), "Bridge can't reach your iPhone" (move it closer, or check
Bluetooth), "Bridge is too far from your iPhone" (move it closer), or "Bridge's Wi-Fi is weak" (move it closer to
your router). While the owner is in control and a warning holds for three checks (5 s apart), the Live Activity
shows it: state `idle`, phase `warning`, `action` the title and `detail` the second line. A warning clears only
after three clear checks, so a signal near a threshold doesn't flip it back and forth, and the alert for a given
warning sounds at most once every 30 minutes.

## Agent control

One setting decides what happens when an agent's first action arrives (`session.mode`):

| Mode | In the app | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| `auto` | Agent control: Always | The agent takes control at once. |
| `countdown` | Agent control: After a delay (Delay: 5, 10, 15 or 30 s) | The agent takes control when the countdown runs out, unless you cancel. |
| `ask` | Agent control: Ask every time | The agent waits for your Allow (up to 2 minutes). |

In `countdown` and `ask`, the request reaches the Live Activity (state `asking`), the app, a desktop
notification and the browser mirror. With a countdown, `pending.deadline` (and the Live Activity's `deadline`)
is when the agent takes control; the request reads "Agent taking control in N s" over the first step ("Opening
Settings"), with **Cancel** (`approve: false`) and **Allow now** (`approve: true`), and when the time runs out the
PC allows it by itself. Without one, it reads "Agent requests control" over the first step, with **Deny** and
**Allow**. If the owner declines or (in `ask`) doesn't
answer, the agent's action fails with a message that tells it to stop. Once allowed, the session lasts until the
agent hands the phone back (`phoneuse done`), the owner takes over, or the agent sends no action for 60 seconds,
which is also when the agent session ends everywhere; after that, the next action asks again. The HID daemon
enforces it: agents' input is refused there until the session is allowed.

## Audio

UxPlay plays the phone's audio on the PC. The PC can't change that while the phone mirrors, so
`POST /v1/mirror/audio` restarts UxPlay with audio on or off (UxPlay's `-as 0`), which ends the mirroring. The
answer has `"needs_remirror": true`, and the app then asks the owner to start Screen Mirroring to the PC's receiver (`pc.receiver`) again
from Control Center. iOS doesn't let apps start Screen Mirroring.

## Push

The app sends its tokens whenever iOS gives it new ones, and all of them again at every launch and whenever it
becomes active, so the PC always has the current build's tokens and `env` (a TestFlight build is `production`, a
development build `sandbox`):

```json
{"bundle_id": "…", "env": "sandbox | production",
 "device": "<APNs device token, hex>",
 "push_to_start": "<Live Activity push-to-start token, hex>",
 "activity": {"id": "<Activity id>", "token": "<that activity's push token, hex>"}}
```

Each field is optional, so the app can send one token at a time. The PC keeps the latest of each.

The PC sends APNs pushes with a token-based key (`~/.config/phoneuse/apns.json`: `key_id`, `team_id`, and the
`.p8` key's path):

- **Start** (topic `<bundle id>.push-type.liveactivity`, push type `liveactivity`), when an agent session starts, to
  the push-to-start token: `event: "start"`, `attributes-type: "AgentActivityAttributes"`,
  `attributes: {"pcName": "…"}`, `content-state` as below, and an `alert` ("An agent is using your iPhone").
- **Update**, to the activity's token, when the agent's action or state changes, at most once per second:
  `event: "update"`, `content-state`.
- **End**, when the session ends (`phoneuse done`, or 60 s without an action): `event: "end"`, the last
  `content-state`, and `dismissal-date` 10 s later.
- **Session request** (topic `<bundle id>`, push type `alert`), to the device token: an alert with category
  `SESSION`, `interruption-level: "time-sensitive"` and `"session_id"` in the payload. The app's notification
  actions **Allow** and **Deny** call `POST /v1/session/answer`.
- **Unlock request** (topic `<bundle id>`, push type `alert`), to the device token: an alert with category
  `UNLOCK` and `"unlock_id"` in the payload. The app's notification actions **Unlock** (with
  `.authenticationRequired`) and **Deny** call `POST /v1/unlock/answer`.
- **Request over** (topic `<bundle id>`, push type `background`, priority 5), to the device token, when a session
  or unlock request ends without the app answering it (answered elsewhere, timed out, or the agent gave up or ended
  its session): `{"aps": {"content-available": 1}, "request_over": {"kind": "session" | "unlock", "id": "…"}}`.
  The app removes the delivered notifications for that request and refreshes the state. Whenever the app refreshes
  the state, it also removes any delivered request notification whose id isn't pending any more.

`content-state` is `{"state": "idle | asking | driving | paused", "phase": "idle | asking | acting | reading | thinking | paused", "action": "Opening Gmail", "steps": 12, "requestId": "…", "deadline": <unix seconds or null>, "startedAt": <unix seconds>, "updatedAt": <unix seconds, float>, "frame": n}`.

While an agent drives, the PC refreshes the activity every second (priority 10: iOS held back priority-5 frames), with `frame` counting up by one
each time; the app draws one animation frame per value (a rotation or a different icon), so the icon keeps moving
for as long as the agent drives. `updatedAt` makes each refresh new content. Timer-driven views (a timer
ProgressView) don't move in the compact Dynamic Island, so these frames are what keep it moving. The app shows one
look per `state`, uses `phase` only while driving, and fills in any missing field, so a payload without one still
updates the activity.

The Live Activity stays on the phone the whole time the phone mirrors to the PC, and ends once mirroring has been
off for 90 s (a stalled picture or a sleeping screen leaves it as it is).
`idle` means the owner is in control. `asking` means an agent waits for the owner's answer to a session request:
`requestId` is the request's id, and the activity shows Allow and Deny buttons that call `POST /v1/session/answer`;
the update that enters `asking` carries an alert, so the Dynamic Island expands. `driving` means the agent uses
the phone, and `paused` that the owner took over. The PC starts the activity by push only when the app hasn't sent
a token for a live one, at most once every 10 minutes per device, and never again in a mirroring session once the
device had an activity in it: Apple makes every start push an alert, and an activity the owner swiped away stays
gone until the next session; the app also starts it itself (the same
attributes and content) when it opens while the PC mirrors and no activity is running.

`phase` says what the agent is doing at the moment: `acting` while Phone Use sends a tap, a swipe or keys to the
phone, `reading` while the agent looks at the screen, and `thinking` between actions, while the agent's model
works out its next step. The phase changes every few seconds, and the PC sends at most one update per second.

## The app

The Live Activity shows the agent's current action, the number of steps and the time since the session started,
with a **Take over** button (a `LiveActivityIntent` that calls `POST /v1/agent/takeover`) and, while paused, a
**Resume** button. The Dynamic Island's compact view shows an icon and the step count.

The app's own screen shows the PC's state and has these settings, each changing the PC at once:

- the agent session: take over or resume, and Agent control (Always, After a delay, Ask every time);
- unlocking: whether a passcode is saved, save or replace it, forget it, and a pending request to approve or deny;
- keep the screen awake;
- the on-screen keyboard: show or hide;
- the pointer: its state, and turning it on or off (an action that asks Siri, after a confirmation);
- the bridge: its status, sending input through it or not, and moving it to another Wi-Fi network;
- the mirror's audio: on or off.
